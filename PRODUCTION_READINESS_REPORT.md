- [ ] Cookie consent
- **Time**: Depends on legal team

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:
1. **Database**: SQLite will fail under load
2. **Payments**: No webhook = potential lost payments
3. **Security**: Debug mode exposes sensitive data
4. **File Storage**: Local storage not scalable

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **Email delivery**: May hit spam without proper configuration
2. **Performance**: No caching layer implemented
3. **Monitoring**: No visibility into production issues

## Recommended Production Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Infrastructure
- Day 1-2: Database migration to PostgreSQL
- Day 3-4: Security hardening and environment setup
- Day 5: File storage migration to S3

### Week 2: Payment & Communication
- Day 1-3: Stripe webhook implementation
- Day 4-5: Email service configuration and testing

### Week 3: Testing & Monitoring
- Day 1-3: Write critical path tests
- Day 4-5: Set up monitoring and error tracking

### Week 4: Documentation & Launch Prep
- Day 1-2: Documentation
- Day 3-4: Staging environment testing
- Day 5: Production deployment
